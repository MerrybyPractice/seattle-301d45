# Project City Explorer

**Author**: Merry Cimakasky, Jessica Zuchowski
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We would like to construct a site that allows users to have a general view of a city they will be visiting, including items like weather, cultural influence, places to eat, map of the area, social gatherings, and outdoor activities. This will be useful for visitors and locals to get a snapshot of the area to find sections that interest them so that the city can be explored in more depth. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user will enter the backend URL into a form and then search for the city they want to explore to interact with the interface. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We will be utilizing APIs such as: Google Maps, Dark Sky, Movie Database, Yelp, Trails, and Meetup. The app is built in JavaScript and utilizes the jQuery library and AJAX to exchange data with the server, and Handlebars templates to generate HTML. CSS is used to style. 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
